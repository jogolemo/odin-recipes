    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you are anything like me, there are days where you want a quick
        meal that is light and healthy. On these days, nothing beats a cold
        and creamy berry smoothie. As long as you have a blender (which I
        assume most of you do) these smoothies are the perfect meal to lift
        your spirits and keep you going the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen raspberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen blackberries</li>
        <li>1 cup oat milk</li>
        <li>(Optional) 2 Tbsp creamy peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, place the frozen berries and oat milk.</li>
        <li>Let the berries thaw in the milk for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once slightly thawed, begin blending the berries.</li>
        <li>If you want to add a bit of protein to your smoothie, add peanut
            butter once berries are partially blended.</li>
        <li>Continue blending until completely smooth.</li>
    </ol>
