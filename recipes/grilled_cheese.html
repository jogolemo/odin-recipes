        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing beats the ooey-gooey divinity of a grilled cheese
            sandwich. Maybe it is nostalgia (or just my love of cheese), but
            occasionally I find myself craving these quick and easy
            sandwiches. After years and years of fine-tuning my
            cheese-grilling skills, I can now say I've mastered my craft. And
            now I would like to share this perfection with all of you!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of your favorite bread (though sourdough works best!)
            </li>
            <li>2 slices of American or Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Butter (unsalted)</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat a pan to medium or medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>While the pan is warming, very lightly spread some mayonnaise
                on both slices of bread.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot, melt half of the butter in the pan and
                then coat one slice of bread with the butter. This should be
                the side opposite the mayonnaise. Remove the slice of bread
                once fully
                coated.</li>
            <li>Put your two slice of cheese on the other slice of bread so
                that
                it is touching the mayonnaise. Repeat step 3 with this slice
                of
                bread as well.</li>
            <li>Place the first slice of bread (butter side out) on top of the
                cheese and grill each side for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from pan and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
