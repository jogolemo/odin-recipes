# odin-recipes

## Description

A simple site consisting of recipes of some of my favorite dishes. This site was built to showcase mastery of HTML fundamentals.

## Objectives

This project will consist of the following HTML concepts:

- Constructing HTML boilerplate
- text elements such as paragraphs and headers
- image elements (jpg, png, gif, svg)
- list elements
- Semantic markup for search-engine and accessibility

## Future Enhancements

As I continue to progress I plan on adding styles with CSS and more advanced interactivity with JavaScript.
